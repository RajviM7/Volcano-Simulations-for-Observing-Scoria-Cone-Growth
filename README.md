# Volcano-Simulations-for-Observing-Scoria-Cone-Growth
Tracks and plots volcanos for multiple parameters in order to observe scoria cone growth. The MatLab code creates figures of the scoria cone shape by graphing each layer of particles during every phase. The parameters include particle ejection velocity, particle ejection angle distribution, size of particles, particles per phase, and number of phases.

# Usage Instructions:
1. Using the MatLab computer software, open the m-file to run and even edit the code to fit your desired inputs
2. Change The parameters from their default setting by simply editting the code. There are also parameter options commented in the code. So copy and paste that uncommented code
3. Make sure the parameters for the right-hand side of the volcano matches the parameters for the left-hand side, unless intented not to
4. Run the code. This may take some time depending on how many particles per phase/phases there are.

A figure will then appear with each layer of particles for each phase. Characteristics of the scoria cone, such as height, volcano width, and crater width can be obtained from these figures.
